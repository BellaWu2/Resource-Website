                <h3>Origins of the Chinese Zodiac</h3>
                <p>It is generally believed the origins of the Chinese zodiac are rooted in zoolatry, or animal worship, with the system dating back to the Qin dynasty, more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that the Jade Emperor summoned all the animals
                    to his palace in a “Great Race” (or possibly for a banquet), and the order in which they arrived determined the animal’s place in the zodiac. With such a rich past, it's little wonder the Chinese zodiac remains so popular throughout
                    China and much of Asia. An integral part of everyday life, it’s used to determine your fortune for the year, marriage compatibility, career path, best times to have a baby, and so much more.</p>

        <h2>Maybe you think your zodiac year (本命年 / ben ming nian) will be lucky. It’s your year after all. However, it’s the total opposite. It’s seen as a hurdle you have jump over. The way to protect yourself from evil spirits and bad fortune is to wear
            red underwear every day for the entire year. Even in modern times, it’s still treated as a real concern. In some places, married men even have to be accompanied by their wives when they go out at night during their year!</h2>

                <p>Your birth year determines your Chinese zodiac sign, but it can get tricky, as the lunar calendar varies from the solar, or Gregorian, calendar. Because the dates of Chinese New Year change every year, individuals born in January or February
                    will need to pay special attention to their birth date in addition to their birth year.</p>
